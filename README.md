# ML-Project-Online-Shopping-Purchase-Intentions

In this problem, we are dealing with data concerning consumer purchase intentions on an online platform [Sakar et al., 2019]. The dataset comprises feature vectors from 12,330 sessions, with each feature encapsulating information regarding a single browsing session on the platform. The dataset is constructed such that each session corresponds to a different user over a 1-year span, mitigating any bias towards a particular campaign, special day, user profile, or period.

Our objective encompasses:

Classifying the user sessions likely to culminate in a purchase.
Scrutinizing features from user sessions to discern pertinent indicators of sessions concluding with purchases.
Delving into the impacts of diminishing training set size and regularization strength on generalization.
Evaluating the effect of the independent variables on all of the selected dependent variables. Feature importance analysis could also be conducted to identify independent variables that significantly influence chosen dependent variables and thus, can serve as robust predictors.

Results are accesssible though notebook.
